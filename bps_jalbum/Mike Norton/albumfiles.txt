# This file is created by JAlbum. It sets custom file filtering and ordering for this image directory.
# Each row indicate a file and it's order. Files not listed here are added to the end of the album
# Rows beginning with "-" indicate excluded files.
# Rows containing a tab character indicate links, where the text before the tab is the logical file name
# and the path to the right is the target path.
# Note: This file allows absolute paths to files and directories in other locations and thereby
# allows you to compile albums consisting of files from several different locations.
