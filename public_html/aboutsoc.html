<h2>About the Society</h2>
</center>
<p>
Bromsgrove Photographic Society was founded in 1950 by a group of enthusiastic amateur photographers.  It continues to promote and support photography as an interest and hobby to it's members.  The society has an active membership of approximately 50 members and supports both film and digital photography.</p>
<p>
There is a varied and active programme of meetings including talks by professional as well as experienced amateur photographers, both print and projected image competitions and studio sessions.  These form a winter programme running from September to the end of May.  The society also organises a full summer programme of local and more distant visits and outings to encourage the development of all aspects of outdoor photography.  This programme runs from the beginning of June to the end of August.
