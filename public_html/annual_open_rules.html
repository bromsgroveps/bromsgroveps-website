<h2>ANNUAL COMPETITION - RULES</h2>
</center>
The Annual Open Competition is held towards the end of each season.<p>
<ul>
    <lh>There will be six sections:</lh>
    <li>General Monochrome Prints</li>
    <li>General Colour Prints</li>
    <li>Nature Prints</li>
    <li>General Monochrome Projected Photographs</li>
    <li>General Colour Projected Photographs</li>
    <li>Nature Projected Photographs</li>
</ul><p> 
Each entrant may submit up to three photographs in each of the six sections.  In the two projected sections, an entry may comprise three digital photographs, three transparencies or two of one medium and one of the other.<p>
Each entrant must have submitted at least one entry into a section of one of the current seasonâ€™s Monthly Competitions to be eligible to submit an entry into that section of the Annual Open.<p>
Entries may have been submitted in previous Monthly Competitions or may be new work.  Under no circumstances may an entry have received an award (Commended or above) in any previous Annual Open competition.<p>
No entry may be the same or similar to another entry from the same entrant in another section of the Annual Open.
Other than as stated above, the rules of Monthly Competitions will apply (e.g. definition of Nature; format of projected digital photographs; etc).<p>
The interpretation of these rules will be at the discretion of the Competition Secretary but, in the event of any dispute, the Committee will decide based on such evidence they see fit to obtain.<p>
