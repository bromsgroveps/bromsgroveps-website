<h2 class="center">Message From the Chairman</h2>

<p>Most people have a camera and enjoy taking pictures.  For the majority this is largely for family events and holidays.  Whatever the level of your interest it is always possible to improve the standard of your photography and therefore the amount of pleasure derived from it.</p>

<p>If you are wondering what a photographic society is like and whether or not it is for you don't be put off by thinking that all members are experts.  The atmosphere of the club is welcoming.  You will be mixing with a group of people with a mutual love of photography and it is up to you just how involved you become.</p>

<p>Come as a visitor and then if you like what you see become a member.  The lectures, competitions and model nights are interesting, enjoyable and will improve your photographic skills.  The programme is shown on this website.
The club exists to encourage all aspects of photography from darkroom to digital so why not come along on a Tuesday evening.</p>
