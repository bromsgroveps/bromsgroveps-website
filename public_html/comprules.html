<h2 class="center">Internal Competition Rules</h2>
Revised July 2010
<br><br>
<h3>Monthly Competition Rules</h3>
There are six classes, which are:<br>
Prints - Mono Prints, Colour Prints, Nature Prints; and<br>
Projected – Mono, Colour and Nature.  Slides and Projected Digital Images will be judged against each other in as near equivalent conditions as possible.<br>
There will be 4 Print and 4 Projected Competitions in each season.<br>
The Competition Secretary will be pleased to answer any questions on the following or on any other matters relating to the Competitions.<p>
</p>
<ol type="1">
    <lh><b>General Rules</b></lh><br><br>
    <li>Entries will only be accepted from fully paid up members. </li>
    <li>All entries must be photographs (made by the action of light of any wavelength on a sensitive surface) of which the entrant holds the copyright. </li>
	<li>Mono is defined as “Monochrome base with up to one added colour” e.g. full sepia plus one colour, but not monochrome base, partially sepia toned plus one colour.  This rule will be interpreted with common sense.</li>
    <li>Members may enter up to four photographs in each class. Each photograph’s class and the name of the entrant must be identified.</li>
    <li>Any entry may be used by the Society for publicity purposes and will be made available on request for inter-club competitions. </li>
    <li>A photograph may be entered a second time in the same class provided it has not been awarded Commended or above in any year. </li>
    <li>A photograph of the same subject and likeness must not be entered in the same competition by the same photographer. </li>
    <li>Photographs of a similar likeness may only be entered in a competition if the title indicates that there is more than one photograph e.g. Flower 1, Flower 2 etc. </li>
    <li>A record of placings made by judges will be kept by the Competition Secretary for appropriate awards to be made. </li>
    <li>All points count towards the two Aggregate Awards for Prints and Projected but only the best score in each month will count towards the six Class Competitions.</li>
    <li>All entries must be handed in on the correct night, clearly identified with the author&acute;s name, class and title.  Any entry not complying with these requirements will be returned. </li>
    <li>The Competition Secretary may use his/her discretion to waive or amend competition rules where appropriate. </li>
    <li>Whilst the Society will take every reasonable care, the liability for any damage to photographs shall be the entrants. </li>
</ol> 
<p></p>
<ol type="1">
    <lh><b>Prints</b></lh><br><br>
    <li>Mono and colour prints may be either home or trade processed.  They must be mounted and no larger than 20 inches by 16 inches including mount.</li>
</ol> 
<p></p>
<ol type="1">
    <lh><b>Slides</b></lh><br><br>
    <li>Slides must be correctly spotted for projection.</li>
</ol> 
<ol type="1">
    <lh><b>Digital Projection</b></lh><br><br>
    <li>Photographic files must be in JPG format with minimum compression and shall be a maximum of 1400 pixels wide or 1050 pixels high. The images must be in a single layer in sRGB colourspace.  File names must be in the format [Projection order][single space][Title].jpg e.g. ‘2 My Photo.jpg’ or ‘3 A Duck.jpg’ no dashes, underscores etc between the number and your title please.  Use capital letters and spaces in the title where they would normally appear; and do not type ‘.jpg’ after the title (as .jpg is inserted automatically by the software).  Files should be submitted in relevant folders entitled ‘Mono’, ‘Colour’ or ‘Nature’.</li>
    <li>Entries may be made on any suitable medium, including by email to the Competition Secretary.  In the case of email, the Competition Secretary will always send a receipt stating the number of readable files received.  Files will be deleted from the computer after a competition if the entrant so requires.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
    <lh><b>Natural History Rules</b></lh><br><br>
    <li>Entries depicting cultured plants, domesticated animals or preserved specimens are not eligible; neither should any manipulation which alters the truth of the photographic statement be entered.</li>
</ol>
