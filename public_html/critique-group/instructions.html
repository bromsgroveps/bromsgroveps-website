        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <p>Below are some instructions or guidlines on how to submit images and give critique as part of this group.</p>

      <section id="instructions">

        <div class="page-header">
          <h1>The Schedule</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="span12">
          Each week three members will be scheduled to submit a single image to the group.
          <hr>
          The schedule is published <a href="./schedule.html">here</a>.
          <hr>
          If a member is scheduled to submit an image, but for whatever reason they can't, they should let the group know so another member can take a turn.
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="page-header">
          <h1>Submitting an Image</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="span12">
          Towards the start of the week each member scheduled to submit an image emails an image to bps-critique-group@googlegroups.com
          <hr>
          The image should be in JPG format with minimum compression and shall be a maximum of 1400 pixels wide or 1050 pixels high. The main reason for this is to keep the size of the email attachment to a minimum.
          <hr>
          Alternatively, the email can include a link to an image hosted on Flickr etc instead of an attachment. Critique for the image should still be given via the email group, however, not as comments on Flickr.
          <hr>
          Included with the image should be some initial comments from the author. Perhaps why they took it. What they were trying to achieve. The camera settings used. What they like about it. What they would like help with. Etc.
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="page-header">
          <h1>Discussion on the Image</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="span12">
          Each member in the group should participate in a discussion on the image. We are a group of differing abilities, so not everyone will feel comfortable in their ability to comment on an image to start with,
          but everyone should try to say something about the image, what they like about it, what they don't. Or ask questions about how it was taken, what processing was done etc.
          The group can only succeed through the participation of the members.
          <hr>
          Every member of the group is taking part to learn, whatever their current level, so all comments must be friendly, helpful and constructive.
          <hr>
          However, we are submitting images for critique, to help us all improve, so we are asking for people to point out how we can improve the image and we must accept everyones opinion as valid.
          <hr>
          The two previous instructions can be interpreted as - be nice - we are all friends here - but tell me how I can improve!
