<h2>PANELS COMPETITION - RULES</h2>
</center>
In the event that a Panels Competition is held during a season, the following rules will apply.<p>
<ul>
    <lh>There will be two sections:</lh>
    <li>Print Panels</li>
    <li>Digitally Projected Panels</li>
</ul>

<ol type="1">
    <li>Entrants should note that there will be no separate Nature section(s) but Nature panels may be submitted in either of the two sections.</li>
    <li>Entrants should also note that a collage of a number of different photographs amalgamated into, essentially, one different photograph will not constitute a panel, however, the appropriate number of such photographs will be considered to be a panel.</li>
    <li>A Print Panel will comprise three prints with a single, collective title.  Each print will indicate its orientation and position within the panel.  No print’s dimensions shall exceed 20” x 16”.</li>
    <li>A Digitally Projected Panel will comprise three or more photographs arranged within a file of no more than 1400 pixels wide by 1050 pixels high.</li>
    <li>Each entrant may submit up to four panels in each section.</li>
    <li>Under no circumstances may an entry have received an award (Commended or above) in any previous Panels competition.</li>
    <li>No entry may be the same or similar to another entry from the same entrant in another section of the Panels competition.</li>
    <li>Other than as stated above, the rules of Monthly Competitions will apply (e.g. format of projected digital photographs; etc).</li>
    <li>The interpretation of these rules will be at the discretion of the Competition Secretary but, in the event of any dispute, the Committee will decide based on such evidence they see fit to obtain.</li>
