<h2>sRGB v Adobe RGB and Photoshop</h2>
After Peter's comments about not getting jpeg files quite right for PDI, I enquired where the mistakes were.  
In my case it was with the colour space of the image.  DiCentra, the siftware we use for displaying images
in the Projected competitions, has it's colour space set to  sRGB.<p>
This set me off checking what I had my camera and Photoshop set to.  I also decided to investigate what Nikon 
had to say about the colour space, I'm a Nikon user.<p>
Put simply the for printing Adobe RGB would appear to be best, for Web or PDI sRGB would appear to be best, but, 
not all the web sites I looked at say exactly the same.
Here are a couple of links I found on the web.  There are loads, have a browse yourself.<p>

<a href="http://www.jseaman.com/articles/srgb.html">Photographic color spaces â€“ sRGB vs Adobe RGB</a>
<p>
If your happy with your set up and are confident that you know your camera, printer etc and have everything profiled 
and correct then this isn't for you.  If you want to have alook at them go ahead.<p>
Here is quick crib sheet I put together for Photoshop to set up the colour space, if you weren't aware of how to do it.<br>
